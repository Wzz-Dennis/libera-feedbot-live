GN:T:SL,"Glacier National Park - Have you ever accidentally left something outside all winter? These forgotten objects sit through winter's worst, and when the snow melts, we rediscover them and inspect the damage. What about things that sit underneath snow and ice for thousands of years? Glaciers and ice patches start out the same wayâ€“with mountain snow that survives the summer. As more snow accumulates without melting away, it can compact and become a more permanent fixture called an ice patch. Unlike glaciers, ice patches don't move or flow, so they often preserve what's hidden beneath them. In 2009, archaeologists realized the need for ice patch surveys in Glacier. With ice melt accelerating, time was running out to see if smaller masses of ice held any clues to Glacier's past. A survey team assembled, including scientists, resource managers, and Native American tribal partners whose ancestral lands span the park. Through ice core testing, they found ice at the bottom of some patches that was 6,000 years old. Park archaeologist Brent Rowley was part of the survey team collecting ice cores in 2013. The team didn't find any human artifacts, but they found remnants of ancient life. At - facebook",https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157998773699912&substory_index=0&id=74553624911,
