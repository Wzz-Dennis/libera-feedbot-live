r/science:15+,"[Physics] Researchers found it's possible to design a sensor, based on quantum physics, that could detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Mathematical simulations showed the approach may offer faster, cheaper, and more accurate detection of Covid-19, including of new variants.",https://redd.it/rtv3r6,https://j.mp/3zf7Yvw
