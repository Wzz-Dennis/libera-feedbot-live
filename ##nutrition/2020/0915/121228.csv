r/science,[Neuroscience] Protein kinase called LRRK2 is thought to contribute to Parkinson’s disease. New study shows that LRRK2 is hyperactive in the skin samples from patients with Parkinson’s which leads to a decrease in protein synthesis. This finding could help in the development of new treatments for the disease.,https://redd.it/it60r0,
r/science,"[Neuroscience] Scientists distinguish between the brain activities of right-handers and left-handers by noninvasively monitoring asymmetric brain responses to passive touch stimulations. Results are key in the study of sensory systems and have implications for brain–computer interfaces, AR and AI.",https://redd.it/it3ifj,
